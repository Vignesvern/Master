P.A.D.A.R.S
(Pipe Anomaly Detection And Repairing System)

Problem:

Everyone come across bathroom pipe leakages in their homes at least once in their lives. When we finally realize that there is a leakage, next challenge is to locate the leak. For this, we must drill into the walls, hence causing infrastructure damage. Therefore, this method is not efficient as it is not 100% accurate in locating all the leaks and causes property damage.

Abstract Idea Of Our Project:

1.Considering these negatives, the importance of detecting the leaks in this complex network of pipes is overwhelmingly high.

2.For accurate and effective detection of the leaks, an I pipe approach is taken which differs from previous detection methods.

3.Our project is about a mobile detection robot powered by Arduino board and has dimensions to fit in the cross-section of a pipe. It comes with a 360 degree sensor module that can detect any anomaly in the pipeâ€™s internal surface(leak).

4.As the device moves inside the pipe, the sensor starts detecting surrounding surface area and when there is a leak ,the 360 degree sensor detects it and locates the point at which repair has to be done.

5.Fricitonally controlled legs are used for providing grip and movement of this system in the cross-section of the pipe

6.This solves the problem of breaking the wall for locating the leak.

7.In the course of time, we also want to add a module which can detect as well as repair the leaks from inside using specific sealants. This can be a major breakthrough as it promises zero infrastructure-damage.
