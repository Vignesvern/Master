P.A.D.A.R.S
(Pipe Anomaly Detection And Repairing System)

Problem:

Everyone come across bathroom pipe leakages in their homes at least once in their lives. When we finally realize that there is a leakage, next challenge is to locate the leak. For this, we must drill into the walls, hence causing infrastructure damage. Therefore, this method is not efficient as it is not 100% accurate in locating all the leaks and causes property damage.
